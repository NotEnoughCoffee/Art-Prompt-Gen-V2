Changes 4/25/2025:
-Created and updated Selection and Category Records
-Determined formatting for Excel sheet that data will be read from
-Created method to Read Excel file (still needs testing) and create the Categories HashMap

Changes 4/26/2025:
-Add error checking to rarity to ensure it is a # and is between 1-3
-minor edits, cleaned up some existing code
-Setup functions to randomly select a Category from the Map.
-Half setup function to randomly pick a selection from within a Category

Changes 4/27/2025:
-Setup Selection randomizer functionality for using rarity system
-Created FormatText utility class for all text formatting functions.
 -set up error checking and number detection
-updated goals
-Created Challenge Class

Changes 4/28/2025
- updated challenge class for more generalization
- planned out initial interface layout
- added a passFilter which loads from a text file (and intended to overwrite the text file on program close)
- passFilter will be used to auto pass anything the filter has kicked out 20 or more times so that things will show up eventually.
- created and tested csv. after troubleshooting file loads in correctly.
- ran a test on challenge class and default challenge appears to be working
- MAJOR progress. file reading and writing now works, passFilter fully implemented and seems functional
- ***Filtering set up for Modifiers -> though some inefficiencies, string references need to be converted to a field***

Changes 4/29/2025
- minor fixes and implemented roll memory save file with load/save methods.
- added search functions to the rolls class to obtain the category or selection from a string input.





CSV TODO:
-categories need updating
-Settings needs to be split to 3 levels
-Time needs level 3
-Modifier Roll needs its own method.

Todo:
-general code cleanup
-update GUI, Buttons, KeyInput and UIText Classes.
 -add key-press functionality
 -add on-screen buttons (with click detection) for same functions.
 -change application screen size and scaling
 -figure out how to refresh the screen when keys/buttons are pressed to display new rolls or other info

-determine challenge types, if a 'custom' mode is feasible (users would be able to alter number of categories rolled, select/disable categories loaded into the program (Categories need an "enabled" boolean), and potentially change weighted odds. Don't forget a reset button
-- would need to consider a lower limit based on how challenge rolls work, and potentially disable rolls, or detect the number of categories available and re-enable the categories if all options are disabled. (WHILE RETAINING USER SELECTIONS STAY DISABLE)
 - maybe just add a second boolean lol
 - and a external memory storage for disabled category choices! haha

-create program background art, button designs, and any other visuals.
-maybe look into creating visual effects (screen transitions)
    - think like JackBox games with vibrant color/high contrast with shaking and fun transitions



---------------------------------------------
            Sample Screen Format:
---------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------
             {Type} Art Prompt:                  : clickable button as well that changes challenge type
 -------------------------------------------
                     |
     Category        |       "    "              : main screen area split into as many divisions as there are rolls?
                     |                           : could do horizontal splits, or randomized effects
     choice          |                           : I would like a visual effect that looks like it is scrolling through a category
                     |
                     |
 -------------------------------------------
    Save | Back | Roll | Forward | Settings      : tied to key presses as well
 -------------------------------------------

Settings:
 - a ReadMe page/popup button
 - Ability to enable/disable categories (all displayed
 - Run check on category map (displays error messages about text formatting issues from Excel file)
 - Clear memory array of recent rolls
 - Custom Challenge Settings:  // MUCH LATER, Low importance
     - # of categories rolled
     - # of times each category is rolled (for multiple results for each)
     - a checkbox to enable/disable the category after it is rolled
     - print lists (displays all options available in each category (with or without rating?)
